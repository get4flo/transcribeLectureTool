Schauen wir uns nun an, welche Kriterien wir überhaupt benötigen, um Tiefe, also so einen 3D-Eindruck, wahrzunehmen. Ich meine, auch im Ingenieurkontext ist es ja interessant, unter anderem unter dem Gesichtspunkt virtuelle 3D-Welten, VR, Videospiele und so weiter. Dort kann man sich fragen, welche Kriterien kann ich überhaupt nachgestalten, welche sind mehr oder weniger hilfreich? Warum reicht mir die dargestellte Tiefeninformation unter Umständen eben nicht aus? Warum erscheint das Bild vielleicht noch immer nicht so realistisch wie die wahre Welt? Und dafür, und damit beginnen wir, braucht man für viele Tiefenkriterien nicht mal beide Augen, sondern nur ein Auge, monokolar also. Unser visuelles System lernt bestimmte Hinweise aus der sensorischen Information im Sinne räumlicher Tiefe zu interpretieren, also beziehungsweise ein dreidimensionales Bild aus ihnen zu erzeugen. Und sobald die Verbindung zwischen Hinweisen und räumlicher Tiefe vollständig erlernt ist, erfolgt die Verarbeitung dieser Hinweise automatisch, also aus dem, was früher im Babyalter sozusagen noch bottom-up war, das wird dann top-down, wir erleben die Welt also zwangsläufig als dreidimensional, weil wir sie als dreidimensional gelernt haben. Und nun stellt sich die Frage, in welchem Alter können denn Menschen nun Tiefenkriterien wahrnehmen? Das schauen wir uns gleich in einem Video an. Und welche Kriterien gibt es überhaupt? Dazu kommen wir nach dem Video. Schauen wir doch zunächst einmal in folgendes Video hinein. ... and on one side there's a checkerboard patterned surface right under the glass. The other side of the table, the patterned surface is way down on the floor, so visually it looks like a big three-foot drop-off. So when human babies first begin crawling, most of them will crawl over the apparent drop-off, but after several weeks of crawling experience, then they'll begin to refuse to crawl over the drop-off. And the conventional interpretation of this was that infants are avoiding the drop-off because they're afraid of heights. She's backing away. She's not interested. She wants no part of that side. The experiment became the shaky foundation for the myth that crawling innately teaches us to fear heights. Babies avoid going over the drop-off because they're afraid of heights. How do we know they're afraid of heights? Because they avoid crawling over the drop-off. So as you may have noticed, the argument is circular. As it happened, the visual cliff was a better test of an infant's depth perception, not their fear of heights. And if you look closely, you may have actually noticed that the babies don't look particularly scared. It is a perfectly safe surface of support. So after one trial, human infants cleverly figure this out, and then they will crawl over the drop-off. So how do you really test if a baby is scared of heights? You can test babies at the edge of a cliff. If you want to know how you can test babies' fear of heights, you can watch the video further. So we see in this experiment with this visual cliff hanger, originally made by Gibson et al. in 1960, they let the babies walk over the glass table, which is not a problem at a certain age, and after a few weeks they don't seem to want to walk over it anymore. So they seem to have learned the depth criteria. And here, Adolphe, I think it was her personally, who we just saw, around 2000, they then examined it again, also with real cliffs, to test the fear of heights of babies. Okay, so after I gave you a few safe experimental ideas for your maybe future or just in the right age to find offspring, let's look at four types and ways that we can distinguish to perceive depths. I've already listed them here. We start with the oculomotor depth criteria, so it's about the position of the eyes, the convergence and focal length of the lens accommodation, I've already told you all about it, which are influenced by the eye muscles around the occipital fold, or the cilia muscles around the lens. In addition, there are also the monocular depth criteria, the motion-induced depth criteria and the cross-dispersion, all step by step. So first of all, the oculomotor depth criteria, they are based on signals that can be derived from movement and change of the eye. So, convergence of the eyes, the eyes turn inward to reach a convergence of the axons at the fixation point, so you shield a little, the further you look away, the more parallel you put your eyes, if you look in infinity. And the accommodation is when you perceive close objects, the cilia muscle contracts, so that the lens thickens and a sharp picture can be created on the retina. So you can say that the brain, from the state of the muscle, directs the distance of the focused object. I mean, you can try it yourself by stretching out your arm, looking at your finger and bringing it closer and closer to you, you've probably done that before, then you notice how the eyes converge, turn together, and how in general this works with the lens, how to sharpen them, we have already looked at in a previous video and also learned that this only works in the near area, so here that with the lens only in the near area up to 3 meters. So our perception arises from the interpretation of biological processes, namely the position of our eyes and so on, and there is a fixed connection between eye position and distance to the fixed object. The monocular depth criteria are called monocular because they are already transmitted through the information to a retina, so we only need one eye for it. So these are monocular depth criteria, i.e. spatial indications that are also noticeable if only one eye is used, and these are criteria that are evaluated when viewing a two-dimensional image, so that a three-dimensional impression is created. And then we can look at the seven most important monocular depth criteria, which you may also know. So on the one hand, you will go through the series in a moment, the linear perspective, you have just heard, the coverage of objects, relative size in the field of view, relative height in the field of view, the usual size of the texture gradient and the atmospheric perspective. Let's start with the atmospheric, with the linear perspective, which is based on the convergence of lines, i.e. lines that go further and further towards the horizon, which always lead, so to speak, to an infinite point, the vanishing point, or the escape point, where the lines would meet each other, as you have already seen with the ponzo illusion. And with such a perspective representation, the lines converge on the escape point and thus we get a deep impression, because that is usually the case with lines that we know in our everyday life. The second is the coverage of objects, which also includes shadows, so coverage also provides us with information with just one eye about which object is closer to the viewer relative to the other, but does not say anything about how much closer it is. So it's just relative and not absolute depth information that we get. And also shadows are created by covering surfaces, which is why it falls in here. So if you imagine in the lower picture that the light comes from above, in which direction do you think the circle is curved? Outwards or inwards? Well, I assume you would say here in the circle that it is curved outwards, because the light comes from above and thus covers the lower part. Shadows are created by covering surfaces and that depends on the lighting. So if you look at the picture here, you won't be quite sure where the points are. Are they hovering in the height or are they in the depth? But if I add a shadow, then it becomes much clearer. Then you see that the objects where they are here in the room. So this object here is apparently at this point, but at this height, while this one is on the ground and is further back in the depth plane. So the position in the room becomes clearer because of the shadow. And the three-dimensionality is also cleared by shadows, which is why the mountains or the contour and how far away something is now is much easier for us because of the fact that shadows fall here. In this picture, you don't necessarily know where the point is, for example, whether it is at the same height or is much further in the depth, which makes it much easier for us here. I can demonstrate the next depth criterion to you as follows. Which of you has the feeling that there is a front and a back ball? And who now has the feeling that this second circle, this one up here, is coming to them? This is the depth criterion of relative size in the field of view. This states that larger appearing objects in the field of view are perceived as closer than smaller appearing objects. That's what AIMS did, you already know it from the AIMS room, by having two balloons in the room like here, and otherwise you didn't see anything else in the room. And the test subjects had the feeling that this balloon was further away, instead of just being smaller. And now that it's a balloon, you could inflate it with air and this continuous enlargement of the balloon seemed to the test subjects as if the balloon was getting closer to them. And again, you might have the feeling that this is a further away circle, and not just four circles of different sizes. So are all other depth criteria constant in two scenes. This is how large objects appear closer than small ones. The next depth criterion is the relative height in the field of view and the horizontal ratio. Because the horizontal line is an important indicator for us and gives us a hint of how far away objects are and how large they are. And so it is that objects that are closer to the horizontal line appear to us as further away. Like this cloud here, which seems to us to be further away than this cloud, because it is closer to the horizontal line. And this here also refers to the people. This person seems to us to be closer than the person behind it. And here, too, we have a horizontal line. Here we see that this horizontal line can now also cut objects into a certain ratio. And that gives us information about how large these objects are. Objects of the same size also have the same horizontal ratio. The horizontal ratio here means that we always see about a third below the horizontal line and two thirds above the horizontal line. That's why they seem to be the same size. And even though the horizontal line cuts the object, it gives us a sense of how large something is. The tree here seems to be higher than the masts because more parts of the tree are above the horizontal line. While here it is always about two thirds that are above the horizontal line, here it is maybe three quarters. That's why it seems higher. By the way, if the horizontal line is not visible, it is not always visible, then we assume it to be at eye level. And this is also the criterion for size ratios. Because over time we learn how large certain objects are. We learn, for example, that a 1-cent coin is smaller than a 2-euro coin. And if we now represent them equally large, then the 2-euro coin seems to us to be further away than the 1-cent coin. And that can be explained by viewing angles. So the view of the 2-euro coin. The view of the 2-euro coin is usually larger on the retina than the view of 1-cent coins. Now we have them, funnily enough, still lying next to each other. Maybe even stronger. In any case, the viewing angle is therefore usually smaller for the 1-cent coin. And if the two coins are at the same distance, now here, so to speak, the same distance to the screen, equally large, then our visual system corrects the information presented in this way, so that we perceive the 2-euro coins as further away. And yes, that can be transmitted, funnily enough, also to all objects with which we have more or less experience. So, Ebott and McMillen have examined the effect of an appropriate size and have found that, well, with cars, with coins we have a lot of knowledge, but with cars we don't have as much experience with their real size as with money. And cars, there are no unit sizes, there are larger cars, smaller cars, and so on. And they have examined how to estimate the size of such cars. And apparently we perceive such an average unit size of cars and are cars, in truth, smaller, but with the distance estimation, yes, if we now see a small car, a really small car, and we are supposed to estimate its distance, then we take the average size, yes, we base the average size on it, and so a small car appears to us further away than it actually is. Yes, for larger cars, of course, the opposite applies, if they are further away, if they are at a certain distance, they seem closer because they are so big. And in fact, you probably drive into smaller cars more often. And if you now manage to drive through the landscape without driving into such a small car and look out of the window, then you may see such a field full of honor, and we recognize another deep criterion, namely the so-called texture gradients. Elements that are equally far apart in a scene seem to be closer together the greater their distance from the viewer. So we assume these honors here are all at the same distance from each other and the further they are away from us, the closer they are packed. Of course, they are also smaller and so on, but the closer they are packed, that's what it's about, they are then here in the picture. Textures are getting finer and finer with increasing distance and the finer the further they change. While we still see a lot of green here, it will always be smaller and finer in the crowd back here as well. Yes, and if we are already talking about fields of honor and co., there is also the atmospheric perspective. Because further away objects are also seen less sharply than near objects and in addition to the fact that particles are now in the atmosphere, such as dust, water droplets and so on, and the further away something is, the bluer it is, even if it is during the day, for example. And in this we can also see whether things are further away or not, because the further away an object is, the more particles are on the line of sight, which, for example, is also used here in well-known pictures to create a depth or such a beautiful atmospheric depth. Yes, let's summarize again, so we have now identified seven monocular depth criteria as the most important and we can actually depict a lot of them here on this example, so to speak, a little bit, for example, the linear perspective, let's go through the coverage of objects, we have here now at least here from the cables that are left here, the relative size in the field of view, i.e. objects that appear larger in the field of view are closer to us or are now perceived as smaller objects, fourth I have another animation that what is further away is closer to the horizon line then we also have the horizon ratio seen objects of the same size also have the same horizon ratio yes here the masks then the fifth the usual size with the same large representation of the objects that are real in their size will differ in the real larger objects as further away appear as the smaller objects and turned around I would have to think about whether we actually see that here in the picture I have noted it here you can also think about it and the texture gradient yes we can see it here now maybe because the objects when they are standing far away here in the back always move closer together yes and the atmospheric depth we don't have that well here to see in the picture we would have to rely on kaspar david friedrich who got it much better than in this pictogram
